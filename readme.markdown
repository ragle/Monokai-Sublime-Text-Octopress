#Monokai-Sublime-Text-Octopress

### Sublime Text Style Highlighting for PHP and JavaScript Coders Running Octopress
##### Forked from bdryanovski's original patch [here](https://github.com/bdryanovski/Octopress---Monokai).

---------------

Just modifying some colors to better match the syntax highlighting I'm used to from Sublime
Text's Monokai highlighting for PHP and JavaScript. 

This is a work in progress, until it's finished - better to [follow bdryanovski's instructions
for applying his patch](http://bdryanovski.github.com/blog/2012/01/04/octopress-theme/), using his color scheme.
